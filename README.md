# odin-recipes

# This project is my first website with the odin project; I'd started working on my own personal site beforehand but I dived right in without learning the basics and admittedly got stuck on something quite easy. 
# So I've started the OP and this is the first project! A recipes websites which will just focus on my skills in html thus far!

# Skills demonstrated:
# Making multiple pages, all connecting to one another. Getting comfortable with lists, paragraphs, headings and so on.
